# C# Binding Overview

`@obinexusltd/obix-binding-csharp` is a TypeScript binding that connects the **libpolycall FFI /
polyglot ABI bridge** to a C# runtime, for Unity integration and the .NET ecosystem.

## What it does

The binding is a thin, typed control plane over one native entry point. It:

- Builds a structured **invocation envelope** for every call.
- Dispatches envelopes across the ABI boundary via `globalThis.__obixAbiInvoker`.
- Returns **typed error objects** instead of throwing at the FFI edge.
- Resolves interop capabilities from a **schema mode** (`monoglot` /
  `polyglot` / `hybrid`).
- Tracks C#-runtime state (memory / concurrency) through dedicated helpers.

It does **not** embed a C# runtime itself — it marshals calls to whatever
native library `ffiPath` points at and records what that library reports back.

## Capabilities

1. Lifecycle: `initialize` / `invoke` / `destroy` / `isInitialized`
2. FFI transport — envelope build + dispatch
3. Schema-mode resolution and validation
4. Typed error model at the ABI boundary
5. .NET and Unity Helpers

## Module map

| Accessor | Type | Responsibility |
|----------|------|----------------|
_This binding is a single module (`src/index.ts`) — no sub-module accessors._

See [03-binding-lifecycle.md](03-binding-lifecycle.md) for the full bridge API.
